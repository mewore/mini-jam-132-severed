# Multiversal Mold: A Journey Through Time and Space

## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea - a rhythm game where the player places lines to restrict the movement of mold or destroy it in order to create shapes 
    - The better-filled a shape is compared to the rest, the higher the score is
    - The tempo of the songs is faster in later levels
    - Main menu concept:
      ![concept-main-menu.png](../../blob/main/concept-main-menu.png?raw=true)
    - Level concept:
      ![concept-level.png](../../blob/main/concept-level.png?raw=true)

### MVP

- [x] ğŸ’™ Bare main menu
- [x] ğŸ’™ Ability to pick a level in the main menu

- [x] ğŸ’™ Slime mold spawns in the level
- [x] ğŸ’™ Time limit, with a timer bar on top of the level
- [x] ğŸ’™ Beat - slight flash, the mold thickens and speeds up
- [ ] ğŸ’™ (Probably not) Line power meter - pressing the [FILL] (W/S/X/RMB) key fills it (the better-synced, the better)
- [x] ğŸ’™ Line creation with the [LINE] (Q/A/Z/Space/LMB) key (pressing it at one beat and letting go of it on another beat) - the line power meter is depleted and how much of it is utilized properly depends on how synced the pressing of the key is
- [x] ğŸ’™ Slime molds avoid growing past lines
- [ ] ğŸ’™ The line creation is cancelled if the maximum line success is no matter at which point the [LINE] button is released
- [ ] ğŸ’™ When a line is created onto a slime mold, the slime mold is cut and disintegrates partially
- [ ] ğŸ’™ When the level ends, the lines fade out and the score is displayed
- [ ] ğŸ’™ Lines decay and when they reach a size of 0, they disappear
