# Multiversal Mold: A Journey Through Time and Space

## TODO

- [x] ğŸ’š MVP idea - a rhythm game where the player places lines to restrict the movement of mold or destroy it in order to create shapes 
    - The better-filled a shape is compared to the rest, the higher the score is
    - The tempo of the songs is faster in later levels
    - Main menu concept:
      ![concept-main-menu.png](../../blob/main/concept-main-menu.png?raw=true)
    - Level concept:
      ![concept-level.png](../../blob/main/concept-level.png?raw=true)

- [x] ğŸ’™ Line creation with the [LINE] (Q/A/Z/Space/LMB) key (pressing it at one beat and letting go of it on another beat) - the line power meter is depleted and how much of it is utilized properly depends on how synced the pressing of the key is
- [x] ğŸ’™ Slime molds avoid growing past lines
- [x] ğŸ’™ The line creation is cancelled if the maximum line success is no matter at which point the [LINE] button is released

- [x] ğŸ’™ At the end of the level, the score is displayed (based on how much of the shapes are covered)
- [x] ğŸ’™ Optimize the molds
